# Horizontal-Ensemble-from-Partial-Dataset
This project implements a horizontal ensemble model using a subset of a dataset, based on a given variant. The subset size is determined independently. Less significant evaluation criteria may be excluded. The ensemble model utilizes the results from the last 50 training epochs.
